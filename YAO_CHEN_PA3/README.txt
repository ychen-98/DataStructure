Introduction: 
This program is designed to solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. It finds a valid placement of N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The program provides a visual representation of the chessboard during execution.


Compilation: 
	make

Execution: 
	make run 

Cleaning: 
	make clean 

Input: 
After running the program with make run, you will be prompted to enter the value of N. Enter a positive integer in [4, 100] to specify the size of the chessboard and the number of queens you want to place. Larger N takes longer execution time. 


Example: 
If you want to solve the 8-Queens problem, enter 8 when prompted.
make
make run
Enter the value of N: 8
